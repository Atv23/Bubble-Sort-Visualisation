# Bubble Sort Visualization

## Overview
This project offers a visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. Aimed at those learning sorting algorithms, this interactive visualization helps in understanding the process of Bubble Sort by visually demonstrating how array elements are compared, swapped, and sorted.

## Features
- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Users can input their own array sizes and values to see how Bubble Sort works with different data.
- **Interactive Controls**: Includes buttons to start the sorting process, reset the array to its original state, and generate a new array for sorting.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: The sorting process is visualized step-by-step, with color changes indicating comparisons and swaps, making it easy to follow along.

## How to Use
1. **Generate Array**: Click on the "Generate Array" button and input the size of the array and individual values as prompted.
2. **Start Sorting**: To begin the visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm, click on the "Start Sorting" button. Watch as the algorithm compares and sorts the array elements.
3. **Reset Array**: If you wish to return the array to its original unsorted state, click on the "Reset Array" button.
4. **Generate a New Array**: You can generate a new array at any time by clicking on the "Generate Array" button again and entering new values.

## Running the Project
To view and interact with the Bubble Sort visualization:
1. Download the `index.html` file.
2. Open the file in a web browser of your choice.
3. Use the on-screen buttons and prompts to interact with the visualization.

## Technical Details
- The visualization is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The sorting algorithm and animations are purely handled through JavaScript, with CSS transitions for smooth visual effects.
- Compatible with most modern web browsers that support JavaScript and CSS3.
